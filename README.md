PEER TO PEER COMMUNICATION

==========================

Author: Juilee Patankar

•	Implemented a peer to peer network, with a specific number of nodes.

•	The network was programmed to search for neighbors at specified intervals of time, and update its list.

•	Each node maintained a set of N neighbors, removed inactive neighbors, 
  and added random neighbors, if there were lesser no of neighbors.
